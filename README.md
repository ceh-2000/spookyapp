# Spookyapp

This is the Google Developer Student Club at W&M's demonstration project for the month of October.

## Prerequisites
1. `npm` (follow this guide for your operating system: https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-install-node-js/)
2. `Angular` (consider creating a test app after installation: https://angular.io/guide/setup-local)
3. `git` (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
4. `python 3.6+` (use `pyenv` package manager: https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/)
5. `pip3` (this is a Python package manager: https://monsterhost.com/what-is-pip-and-how-to-install-pip3/)   
5. `VS Code` (optional: https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Getting started (Mac/Linux)
1. Open a new session of Terminal.
2. Make sure `npm` is installed correctly using `npm -V` and check for `Angular` with `ng -V`.
3. Clone this repository so you can use it locally: `git clone [REPO_LINK]`
4. `cd spookyapp`
5. Type `rm -rf .git` to remove Github dependencies. You can attach this project to your own Github repository at this point using [this](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github) guide. 
6. Run `npm install` to get the package dependencies.

## Running the app

Run `ng serve` for a dev server from the project root. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Creating new Angular components, services, etc.

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Deploying to Firebase Hosting

1. Navigate to [https://firebase.google.com/](https://firebase.google.com/). 
2. Click "Go to console" in the upper right corner and create a new project.
3. From the project dashboard click on "All products" in the left panel and select "Hosting" â†’ "Get started".
4. Minimize the webpage and open Terminal. From command line run `npm install -g @angular/cli`.
5. Run `npm install -g firebase-tools`.
6. Run `firebase login` and enter your credentials for Firebase.
7. Run `firebase init hosting` and answer the prompts as follows:
- What do you want to use as your public directory? `dist/spookyapp`
- Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? `y`
- Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub? `N`
- (Optional) File `dist/spookyapp/index.html` already exists. Overwrite? `y`
8. Run `ng build` to create a production build in the `dist/spookyapp/` directory.
9. Deploy to firebase hosting with `firebase deploy --only hosting`.
10. Navigate to the outputted URL and check that the deployment worked.

## Local Google Cloud Functions

These instructions come from: https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/writing.

1. Open a command line session.
2. Check that `python` installed correctly: `python -V`. Check that `pip3` installed correctly: `pip3 -V`.
3. We need to set up our directory structure. 
   - From the project root, enter `mkdir functions` in the command line. 
   - `cd functions`
   - `mkdir my-spooky-function`
   - `cd my-spooky-function`
   - `touch main.py`
   - `touch requirements.txt`
   - Type `ls` to check that your files are there and `pwd` to make sure your path is correct.
4. Open `requirements.txt` in the Text Editor of your choice (this could be VS Code) and add the following:
  `functions-framework==3.*`
5. Open `main.py` and add the following:
```
import functions_framework

# Register an HTTP function with the Functions Framework
@functions_framework.http
def my_http_function(request):
  # Your code here
      
  # Return an HTTP response
  return 'Your local function works!'
```
6. Deploy your function locally using the following: `functions-framework --target=my_http_function --port 8000`
7. Check that your function worked by going to the following link in your browser: [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
8. Type Control+C in Terminal to kill the process running your local function.

## HTTP endpoints with an Angular service
1. From the project root in a command line session, type `ng generate service call-api-endpoint`
2. Go into `package.json` and ensure `rxjs` uses a version matching the pattern `7.x.x`. This is necessary to use the function `firstValueFrom()`.
